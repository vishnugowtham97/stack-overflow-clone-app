## Stack Overflow Clone
This is a clone of the Stack Overflow website built with React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. The project aims to replicate the core functionalities of Stack Overflow, allowing users to ask questions, provide answers, and interact with the community.

# Features
User Registration and Authentication: Users can create new accounts, log in, and log out. Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session management.

Question Creation and Viewing: Users can create new questions, providing a title, description, and tags. They can also view questions posted by other users, along with their respective answers.

Answering Questions: Users can provide answers to questions posted by others. They can also upvote or downvote answers based on their usefulness.

Search Functionality: Users can search for questions based on specific keywords or tags, helping them find relevant information easily.

User Profiles: Each user has a profile page that displays their information, including their questions, answers, and any relevant statistics.

# Tech Stack
The project is built using the following technologies:

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js is used to create the frontend of the application, providing an interactive and responsive user interface.

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows server-side execution of JavaScript code. Node.js is used to build the backend of the application, handling HTTP requests and interacting with the database.

Express.js: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express.js is used to create the RESTful API endpoints and handle routing in the backend.

MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database used to store and retrieve data. MongoDB is used to store user information, questions, answers, and other relevant data for the application.

Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. Mongoose is used to define data models, interact with the MongoDB database, and perform database operations.

JWT: JSON Web Tokens are used for user authentication and session management. JWTs are generated upon user login and sent with each request to authenticate and authorize access to protected routes.

Bcrypt: A password hashing library used for secure storage of user passwords. Bcrypt hashes and compares passwords to ensure secure authentication.
